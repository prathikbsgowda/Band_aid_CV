# Future Scope

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for overlaying a band-aid on an arm using computer vision. While functional, there are several opportunities to expand and enhance this work:

1. **Enhanced Arm Detection**  
   - Replace skin segmentation with advanced deep learning models (e.g., U-Net or Mask R-CNN) for more accurate and robust arm segmentation under different lighting and skin tones.

2. **Real-Time Application**  
   - Extend the project to process video streams (e.g., webcam or smartphone camera) to apply the band-aid overlay in real-time.

3. **3D Overlay and AR Integration**  
   - Use Augmented Reality frameworks to create a 3D band-aid model that can adapt to the curvature of the arm for more natural visualization.

4. **Personalization and User Interaction**  
   - Allow users to upload their own arm image directly into the system.  
   - Provide multiple band-aid options (different sizes, colors, or cartoon/medical designs) so users can select the one they want to apply.  
   - Add a simple UI (using Tkinter, Flask, or Streamlit) for an interactive experience.

5. **Healthcare Applications**  
   - Adapt the system for patient education (e.g., demonstrating proper wound dressing techniques).  
   - Extend for clinical uses like simulating placement of medical devices (IV patches, sensors, etc.).

6. **Cross-Platform Deployment**  
   - Deploy as a mobile app or web application to make it accessible to healthcare professionals and patients outside of a Python environment.
